# Next.js Application with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Material-UI, Base Web, Husky, lint-staged, and Prettier

This is a boilerplate README file for a Next.js application using TypeScript as the primary language. The project includes additional libraries such as Tailwind CSS, Material-UI (BaseUI), Husky, lint-staged, and Prettier for enhanced development experience and code quality.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v18.15.0 or higher)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (v6 or higher, recommended for this project)

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. Change into the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

3. Install project dependencies using pnpm:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

## Development

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the Next.js development server, and your application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Building for Production

To build the application for production, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This command will create an optimized production build of your Next.js application.

## Additional Features

The project includes the following additional libraries:

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/): A popular React UI framework with a wide range of components and themes.
- [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/): A Git hook manager for running scripts before committing or pushing code.
- [lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged): A tool for running linters on staged files, used in combination with Husky.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): A code formatter that ensures consistent code style throughout the project.
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/): An authentication library for Next.js applications, providing a simple and flexible authentication solution.

## Code Quality and Formatting

The project utilizes ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting. You can run the following command to lint your code:

```bash
pnpm lint
```

To automatically fix linting errors, you can run:

```bash
pnpm lint:fix
```

The project also includes a pre-commit hook that runs linting and formatting checks before each commit, ensuring that only clean and formatted code is committed.

## Customize Configuration

You can customize the configuration for ESLint, Prettier, and other tools by modifying the respective configuration files:

- `.eslintrc.js`: ESLint configuration file.
- `.prettierrc.js`: Prettier configuration file.
